# Challenge My Portfolio

## Description

The challenge for week 2 was to create our initial portfolio page and deploy it on Github

- What was your motivation?  This was my first real attempt at creating an actual portfolio from scratch.
- Why did you build this project? I built this to begin to develop a professional portfolio.  This is certainly a work in progress, but I feel it's a good start
- What problem does it solve? The project gave me an opportunity to hone my html and css skills while developing the first page in my portfolio.
- What did you learn?  A ton to be honest.  Getting the aside to stick and behave like a future sidebar menu took me the better part of a day.

The main portions of the page that intended.

- Header with my name using CSS styling to make the "Wilson's" stand out
- nav bar at the top with links to my github repo and the gitlab UTSA site
- A picture of me and a quick paragraph describing the page
- An aside menu bar that I plan on adding functionality to in the future
- Three content sections with the first having a functional link to the deployed challenge 1 page.  The second is a place holder with an image for new challenges.  The third is an image created using - stabledifusion, with a hidden ul explaing how I got the txt to img generator to spit out the panda.
- Finally the footer with my contact info that locks itself at the bottom of the page.
- I also used flex to ensure that items would wrap when viewed on smaller screens.

## Installation

The portfolio page is pretty straightforward.  You can follow the deployed link listed below, or conversely download my repo and run the index in a local browser.

Page consists of the following
- index.html
- style.css (./assets/css/)
- reset.css (./assets/css/)
- various images used in the index (./assets/img/)

## Usage

Feel free to use any and all parts of this.

Note the panda image was created with StableDiffusion.

Instructions for re-creating the panda image are on the page.

## Credits

Thanks to the folks at both MDN and W3.  The walkthrough getting footers to stick to the bottom of the page and side menus to stay put were particularly helpful.
